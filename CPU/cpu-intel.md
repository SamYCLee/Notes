# Intel CPU

## Introduction

This note is dedicated for the knowledge of Intel CPU.

## Product Properties

### Naming

Intel has their own format of naming with different meanings.

For Core series, using Core I7 8700K as an example:

| Example Value | Meaning | Remarks |
|:----:|----|----|
| I**7** | The number next to the 'I' after 'Core' represents the kind of overarching performance a chip has <br/><br/> - Core I3: on the lower end of performance that's best suited for budget computers <br/><br/> - Core I5: on the mid-range of performance that's suited for casual users and power users on a budget. <br/><br/> - Core I7: on the higher end of performance that's suited for power users and professionals for power-hungry apps like Photoshop or video editing. |  |
| **8**700K | The first of the four numbers on Intel's Core chips represents the generation of the chip, the lower the number, the older the generation. ( See the Generation Table for more information ) |  |
| 8**700**K | The three following numbers after the generation number represent performance. The higher the numbers, the more powerful the chip <br/><br/> The major difference is "clock speed" and "boost clock speed." The higher the clock speeds, the faster the chip can process what you want. |  |
| 8700**K** | Intel's chips have letters like "K" and "U" after the numbers that give you an idea of what kind of purpose and performance the computer is designed for. <br/><br/> Some computers have Intel chips <b>without any letters.</b> Those are the standard, base chip models. <br/><br/> **K**: usually the fastest, with higher clock speeds than the standard chips without a letter in Intel's mainstream chips. It also means the chip is "unlocked," where its clock speeds can be tweaked — or "overclocked — by a user to squeeze out a little extra performance than what you get out of the box. <br/><br/> **G**: has a built-in graphics processor. Most of Intel's chips come with basic built-in graphics processors so you can display something on your monitor without an entirely separate graphics card. But Intel's "G" processors come with a more powerful graphics processor for more power-hungry apps and games. Surprisingly, the graphics processors in Intel's "G" chips come from the company's main rival, AMD. <br/><br/> **T**: designed to use less power while also having less performance than the standard chips without any letters. <br/><br/> **U**: designed for laptops and mobile devices, as "U" chips are Intel's "ultra-low power" models. They're "low power" because they use even less power than the "T" models and have slower clock speeds than their full-size, non "U" equivalents. By having slower clock speeds, they don't get as hot and have a lower risk of heat-related damage. That's good for thin laptops that have limited cooling compared to larger desktops and laptops. |  |
